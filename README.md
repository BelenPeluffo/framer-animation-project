# This is where it all starts

The basic idea is to creat an app that shows you data of k-pop idols in an interactive way.

The layout would be like a Prezy canvas where you have all these circles and when you click on any of them, you'll be shown the data for that circle after some cool animations. You'll have a bar at the bottom of the viewport, invisible, where all the action buttons will appear.

The app will accept key and, in the future, mouse gestures, also.
