# This is where it all starts

The basic idea is to creat an app that shows you data of k-pop idols in an interactive way.

The layout would be like a Prezy canvas where you have all these circles and when you click on any of them, you'll be shown the data for that circle after some cool animations.

The app will accept key and, in the future, mouse gestures, also.
